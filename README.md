Processing sketches

This is a terrible README file. Please fix. A few other recommendations:

- You need a Wiki
- If you haven't yet, ensure you apply some form of machine learning
- Is this project agile compliant? 
- CI/CD nuff said
- Real men do it in prod

Also, the Product Owner would prefer a box as opposed to a circle on the cover. Change required ASAP. They've promised the new feature will be released by the end of the week.
